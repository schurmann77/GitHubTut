			<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
			<a href="index.html">

			</a>
			<p>My name is Chris, and I've recently graduated from the University of Mississippi with a Bachelor's of Applied Science, 
				Paralegal Studies. I have always held an interest in coding, but I didn't want my degree to be in Computer Science. I felt that I could 
				get the skills I needed to learn and apply them elsewhere, and wrap in my unique way of thinking along the process. </p>
			<p>I found a job right out of college, and they were actually a mix of Software Development and information systems, within the
				Real Estate realm. That job fostered my curiosity about coding even further. <strong>I taught myself the fundamentals of C#, and 
				then went on to learn HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.</strong></p>

			<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>

			<p>Like I mentioned above, I worked for a Software Development company within the Real Estate realm right out of college.
				It was nice, and I loved the work environment, every one was so friendly! I was looking for something more, though, something
				to challenge me. So I started branching out and applying to entry level developer jobs.</p>
			<p><span style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid darkblue;">That's when I was given the chance to prove myself to Genesis10.</span> They had a program called Dev10 that was absolutely perfect for someone like me. 
				They wanted people who had graduated with a STEM degree (which mine is still a science, so it counts) but didn't require any coding
				experience. I decided to give it a shot, and gave their rigorous application process a shot.</p>

			<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
			<img src="images/computer1.jpg" alt="A picture of the first PC I ever built." style="width: 350px;" />
			<p>My hobbies include building top-notch Gaming PCs, competitive FPS gaming, some programming, and spending time with my 2 year old.
				You read that right, <em>a 2 year old</em>. Yes, I finished college after having a child during my junior year. </p>
			<p>Not only did I do that, but I also worked 2 jobs, ran my own business on the side, and graduated on time. I guess you could say my ambition to succeed is the
				most noticeable thing about me. I thrive when I'm under pressure, and children put you under enormous pressure to provide.
